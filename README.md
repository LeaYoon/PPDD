# PPDD
This repo provide guidance for port road data and codes for road crack segmentation.

# Intallation
This code is tested under torch==2.0.1 and Geforce RTX 3080

# Dataset Preparation
PPDD Dataset download link : [Click here to try](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jiR-q0W8wZvoQqv-a1otfEKdToatf6lZ?usp=sharing)

Dataset path is set from config file following mmdetection and mmsegmentation protocol.
If you are new to those protocol, refer to [the documentation](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Training and Test
This codebase is same with mmdetection and mmsegmentation.
Therefore, you can reproduce our experiment with only uploaded configuration file and mmdetection command
```
PPDD/mmdetection/config/PPDD
```

## Training
```Python
# instance segmentation with mask2former-swins
python tools/train.py <INSTANCE_CONFIG_FILE>
# semantic segmentation with deeplabv3+
python tools/train.py <SEMANTIC_CONFIG_FILE>
```

## Test
```
python tools/test.py <SEMANTIC_CONFIG_FILE> <MODEL_PATH> --show-dir <OUTPUT_PATH>
```
